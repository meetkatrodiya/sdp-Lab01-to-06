Challenge 5: Quadratic equations
A quadratic equation is something of the form

x = (-b ± sqrt(b2 - 4⋅a⋅c)) / (2⋅a).

Declare three constants named a, b and c of type double.
Then calculate the two values for x using the equation above
(noting that the ± means plus or minus, so one value of x for
each). Store the results in constants called root1 and root2
of type double.
