  //Dart Classes
  /*
      Classes are like architectural blueprints that tell the system 
      how to make an object, where an object is the actual data 
      that’s stored in the computer’s memory

      If a class is the blueprint, then you could say the object is like 
      the house that the blueprint represents

      Classes are a core component of object-oriented 
      programming. They’re used to combine data and functions 
      inside a single structure.

      Functions inside of a class are known as methods, while constructors are 
      special methods you use to create objects from the class.

      Dart also has a second type of generative constructor called a

      on to the class name. It takes the following pattern:

      ClassName.identifierName()

      User.anonymous() { 
        id = 0;
        name = 'anonymous';
      }

  // Adding named parameters for User
  // User({this.id = 0, this.name = 'anonymous'});

  // Initializer lists
  // Private variables
  /*
      Dart allows you to make variables private by adding an 
      underscore (_) in front of their name

       using an underscore before a 
        variable or method name makes it library private, not class 
        private.

        Another thing you can do is to make the properties immutable, that 
        is, unchangeable. By using immutable properties, you don’t 
        even have to make them private.

          // Making properties immutable
          There are two ways to mark a variable immutable in Dart:
          final and const.

          However, since the compiler won’t know
          what the properties are untilruntime, your only choice here is 
          to use final.

  // Factory constructors
  /* 
        Dart also provides another type of constructor called a factory constructor.
        
        The factory constructor is basically a special method that 
        starts with the factory keyword and returns an object of the 
        class type

        factory User.ray() {
          return User(id: 42, name: 'Ray');
