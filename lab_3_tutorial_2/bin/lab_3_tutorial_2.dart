    repeating that code in multiple spots presents at least two problems.

    2) The second, and more troubling problem, is that if you need to change 
      the logic in that bit of code later on, you’ll have to track down all of 
      those instances of the code and change them in the same way.

  // Function Name: should follow lowerCamelCase
  // Parameteres: they are input to the functions, parameter name should also be written in lowerCamelCase
  //return value: it should match with return type

      The return type, function name and parameters are collectively known as the function signature.

  //  Writing good functions
  //writing DRY code is one of the technique to write good functions
  //others things that should be taken care are:

  //  Avoiding side effects
  /*When you write a function, you know what the inputs are: the
            parameters. You also know what the output is: the return 
            value. Anything beyond that, that is, anything that affects the 
            world outside of the function, is a side effect.

            void hello() { 
              print('Hello!');
            }
              Printing something to the console is a side effect, because 
              it’s affecting the world outside of the function. rather we can write above function
              to resolve side effect

              String hello() { 
                return 'Hello!';
              }
          */

  //   Pure Functions:- they always return the same output for any given input.

  //  Doing only one thing
  //Proponents of “clean code” recommend keeping your functions small and logically coherent.
  /*
              If a function is too big, or contains unrelated parts, 
              consider breaking it into smaller functions.
            */

  //  Choosing good names
  //You should always give your functions names that describe exactly what they do.
  /*
              there are a few additional naming 
              conventions that Dart programmers like to follow. These are 
              recommendations, not requirements, but keep them in mind
              as you code

              ->  Use noun phrases for pure functions; that is, ones 
                  without side effects
                  ex. use averageTemperature instead of getAverageTemperature 
              
              ->  Use verb phrases for functions with side effects. 
                  ex. updateDatabase or printHello.
              
              ->  Don’trepeat parameter names in the function name.
                  ex. use cube(int number) instead of cubeNumber(int number)
  
          */

  // Optional types

          }

          to fall back on dynamic forthe unknown parameter type. above is same as

            return '$number is a very nice number.';
